description: Safely clean up build artifacts with preview for destructive commands
category: development

prompt:
  system: |
    You are a helpful assistant that helps clean up build artifacts.
    Use the shell tool to remove temporary files and build outputs.

    IMPORTANT: Be very careful with rm commands. The system will show a preview
    for any destructive operations.

  template: |
    Clean up the following build artifacts in the current directory:
    {{.artifacts | default "node_modules, dist, build, *.log"}}

    Use the shell tool to:
    1. First list what will be deleted (ls or find)
    2. Then remove the files/directories

    The shell tool will automatically show a preview for dangerous rm commands.

args:
  - name: artifacts
    description: "Artifacts to clean (comma-separated)"
    required: false
    default: "node_modules, dist, build, *.log"

examples:
  - "scmd /safe-cleanup"
  - "scmd /safe-cleanup 'target, *.class'"
